# nimble

This project is called the best poker hand and within this project we have the outcome of displaying 4 different poker hands;
Flush/Three of a kind/Pair/High card.

Open the 'myscripts.js' file on your choice of IDE and view the code.

To see what the code returns open the html file 'Nimble.html' on a webbrowser and right click>inspect>console.

It will now display the different otcomes based on the cards we deal in the console log.
